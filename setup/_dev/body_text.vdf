"WARNING: insomniaHUD is in BETA! Certain things WILL be unskinned and WILL be broken! This HUD is in active development and gets updated DAILY! Be sure to update it often, and report any and all bugs you encounter to the HUD's GitHub repo issues page.

The latest version is always available on GitHub, and it is recommended you get it there. All other sites (Gamebanana, Mastercomfig HUDS, etc...) will almost always receive updates later, and thus, you may not always get the latest version.

Thank you for choosing insomniaHUD.

NOTICE: IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY, RENAME THE INSOMNIAHUD FOLDER TO insomniaHUD NOW! IF YOU FAIL TO DO SO, NONE OF THE CUSTOMIZATION FEATURES WILL WORK!"
